    "You are on a game show and given the choice of whatever is behind three doors. Behind one door is a fantastic prize (some examples use a car, others use cash) while behind the other two doors is a dud (some examples say a goat, others say it's just empty). You pick a door. Then the host opens one of the other two doors to reveal a dud. But here's the wrinkle: the host now gives you the opportunity to switch your door. What should you do?"

This means that there was a 2/3 chance of the fantastic prize being behind the other two doors. Once the host opens one of the other doors, you know the prize wasn't behind the opened door. So there's a 2/3 probablity of the prize being behind the final door. So you should switch because you're doubling your chance of getting the prize. \n",
